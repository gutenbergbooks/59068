<p>Houston, the reporter for the London
<i>Daily Mail</i> wrote, &ldquo;has caused me to lift my ban on the word fabulous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next year, 1956, the London <i>Times</i> speculated that America might &ldquo;eventually
be based on a quadrilateral of great cities&mdash;New York, Chicago, Los Angeles,
and Houston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That year, too, the New York <i>Times</i> quoted Lloyd&rsquo;s of London: &ldquo;Within 100
years Houston will be the largest city in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston: one of &ldquo;The 12 Most Exciting Cities of North America,&rdquo; said
<i>Holiday</i> in 1953&mdash;one of the dozen, from Quebec in the north to Mexico City in
the south, possessing &ldquo;that rare combination of qualities which has always spelled
greatness.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Few Houstonians see their city in such remarkable terms. Few understand
why their city provokes such estimates by others.</i></p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The first known sketch of Houston was made by a British artist,
who never saw the place, to illustrate a book written by Matilda Charlotte
Houstoun, an Englishwoman who did see Houston in the early 1840s. The
artist apparently took her description of Buffalo Bayou&rsquo;s big banks to mean
hills.</i></p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Years later, perhaps in 1868, a French artist seems to have used the Englishman&rsquo;s
sketch as a model for one of his own, below, making mountains of the
hills.</i></p>

<p>Roughly the size of Warsaw, Stockholm, Singapore, and Naples, of Bucharest
and Brussels and Munich, Houston is prosaically listed in the Bol&rsquo;shaia Sovetskaia
Entsiklopediia&mdash;the Soviet Encyclopedia&mdash;of 1957 as a &ldquo;Railway and airline junction.
Important industrial, commercial, and financial center in the South of the
USA.&rdquo; Even an American encyclopedia is hardly expected to describe the city&rsquo;s
festival atmosphere, its spirit of play, which derives in part from a surprising
characteristic described by Arthur C. Evans, a man well seasoned in life, who
wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to think of Houston as being masculine. It wouldn&rsquo;t do. Houston is
not a masculine city in the sense that New Orleans or San Francisco is masculine.
And so, for me, at any rate, it is <i>Miss</i> Houston, a beguiling, vibrant, radiantly
healthy adolescent&mdash;and I love her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston, Promised Land or New Golconda or whatever writers say of it, is a
city of great expectations. Ambitious, confident, it moves swiftly, restlessly. Its
profile, a transfiguring skyline moored to the flat Gulf plain, vaguely resembles
other modern skylines, but Houston resembles nothing in the world except itself.
Ever since World War II the city has beguiled observers, who often approach it
with preconception, and often leave it with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Air conditioned Tower of Babel, anchored on gold, gall and guts,&rdquo; the author
James Street wrote of it. &ldquo;An adolescent Amazon with a little gland trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is plain Simon-pure American inspiration,&rdquo; the <i>American</i> Magazine said
of it.</p>
<p>It &ldquo;has a strength and power and rude majesty all its own,&rdquo; the St. Louis
<i>Post-Dispatch</i> said. &ldquo;In time, perhaps, it will achieve greatness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ship channel, Oil, and Two World Wars
made Houston what it is. The second age of discovery may make it what it becomes.
As Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Balboa, Magellan, Captain Cook, and
others opened the unexplored seas and lands of the earth during the first age of
discovery, so the men who are opening the unexplored space of the universe have
begun the second age.</p>
<p>In 1961, when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration decided to
build its Manned Spacecraft Center near Houston, the city began an identity with
the old ports of western Europe that played leading roles in the great adventures
of two, three, and four centuries ago. Technical direction of America&rsquo;s effort to
put the first man on the moon will come from Houston.</p>
<p>The government is spending well over a hundred million dollars&mdash;it may come
to far more than that in the end&mdash;to build office buildings, laboratories, and massive
test communications and control facilities on range land near Clear Lake.
The millions of dollars to be invested by industry to serve the center are incalculable.
Slowly the character of the city will change as the migration of space
scientists merges with Houston and with oil, the city&rsquo;s mover and shaker for half
a century. &ldquo;It is likely,&rdquo; the Dallas <i>News</i> said in 1962, &ldquo;that even many Houstonians
have no conception of what is happening and what it may mean to their
community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the astronauts moved to Houston in 1962, their presence gave breath
to what had seemed a fantasy to many Houstonians, who more than most Americans
will experience vicariously the most extraordinary adventure in history. How
far Houston has come since two New Yorkers paid $9,428 for a townsite and
named it for the hero of the Battle of San Jacinto! The interval between that date
and the arrival of the astronauts was but 125 years. What is Houston that it has
become so much?</p>
<p>Beginning life three thousand years after Athens and two thousand after
London, beginning two centuries after Boston and New York, fifty years after
Los Angeles and at nearly the same time as Chicago, Houston suddenly joined
the family of metropolises midway in the twentieth century. Its likeness in history,
however, is to none of those cities, but to Carthage of North Africa, one of the
most famous cities of antiquity, whose beginning preceded Houston&rsquo;s by twenty-six
centuries.</p>
<p>Carthage, like Houston, was above all a commercial city, its people vigorous,
practical. At one time Carthage was famous for the great wealth of its leading
families; Houston was once known as the Land of the Big Rich. And the sea, or
access to it, was the key to the rise of both. As Carthage became the richest city
of the western Mediterranean, Houston became the richest of the Gulf of Mexico.
Carthage lived for fifteen centuries and died abruptly, disappearing from history.</p>
<p>The largest of twenty-one places named Houston in the United States, not
counting Houston City and Houston Junction, both in Pennsylvania, Houston
is the seventh American city in population and the second, after Los Angeles, in
land area. But to call Houston the seventh city in population, though correct, is
unrealistic. The true population of a modern city is shown not by the number of
people living within its legal limits but by the number living within its metropolitan
area, which for Houston is Harris County. By that measure, Houston ranks
sixteenth in population.</p>
<p>Whatever its rank, Houston is often said to be a small town with an enormous
population. Such a notion becomes increasingly hard to support except for
one aspect, which was shown by B. D. (Mack) McCormick, a collector of folk
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
music. He described the city in a pamphlet accompanying each of two recordings,
produced in England in 1960, of the Houston area&rsquo;s folk music.</p>

<p>Houston is &ldquo;less a city than it is an amalgam of villages and townships surrounding
a cluster of skyscrapers,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Each section of the city tends to
reflect the region which it faces, usually being settled by people from that region.
Thus the Louisiana French-speaking people are to be found in the northeast of
Houston; the East Texas people in the northern fringe, which itself is the beginning
of the Piney Woods; the German and Polish people are in the northwest
Heights; and so on.... Each area surrounding the city has gathered its own, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
each group has in turn established a community within the city.... And so the
city, which in itself has no cultural traditions, is rich in those it has acquired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>McCormick quoted Sam (Lightnin&rsquo;) Hopkins, a Negro folk singer, who spoke
of a Houston unknown to many Houstonians: &ldquo;The idea of it is that everybody
&rsquo;round here plays music or makes songs or something. That&rsquo;s white peoples, colored
peoples, that&rsquo;s them funny French-talking peoples, that&rsquo;s everybody, what
I mean. They all of &rsquo;em got music.&rdquo; McCormick himself has said, &ldquo;More Englishmen
than Houstonians see Houston as a rich source of traditional lore, though
otherwise the British think of Houston in clich&eacute;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much of the area&rsquo;s past is deep-etched in folk music. One song was sung by
Huddie (Lead Belly) Ledbetter, a Negro convict and perhaps the most famous
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
of colored folk singers. The song, titled &ldquo;The Midnight Special,&rdquo; begins:</p>
<div class="verse">

<p>Many &ldquo;think of Houston as a cluster of
mud huts around the Shamrock Hotel, in the cellars of which people hide from
the sticky climate, emerging at long intervals to scatter $1000 bills to the four
winds,&rdquo; Gerald Ashford wrote in 1951. Such a fancy formed a dominant theme
of Houston appraisals during a brief and a bizarre period. The myth that Houston&rsquo;s
population consisted mainly of the rich was absurd, but the millionaire legend,
though arresting to the world, was a liability to Houston. For one thing, it
obscured the city&rsquo;s reality, which was itself exceptional enough.</p>
<p>The Shamrock Hilton Hotel, built by the wildcatter Glenn H. McCarthy at a
cost of $21,000,000, opened on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day of 1949 with what turned out to
be a spectacle. Conrad Hilton took control of the hotel in the spring of 1955. The
two dates roughly mark the period of the legend&rsquo;s vigor.</p>
<p>Still, it was in some ways an exhilarating time, and it left Houston with an
extravagant folklore. The goose hung high. The legends die reluctantly: An oilman
was said to have offered his daughter $5000 for every pound she lost; a
Houston man who sent a new Cadillac to Europe to have a $5000 custom body
put on its chassis was said to have told the craftsmen to &ldquo;Throw the old body
away;&rdquo; wanting to play a joke on a colleague who was traveling in Europe, another
Houstonian had a fair-sized roller coaster built in the traveler&rsquo;s wooded yard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>But the maybe-so stories are less remarkable than many of the authentic ones.
A Houston oilman well known for eccentricity and boyish hedonism was staying
at a hotel in Los Angeles one night in 1955. He wished to awaken at a certain early
hour the next day, so he made a long-distance call to a man on his staff in Houston
and told the man to call him in Los Angeles at the specified hour the next morning.
In 1957 a Houston high school girl received a graduation gift from her father,
an oilman: wrapped and tied in her school colors, it was a map and a legal assignment
of the overriding royalties in a lease near Odessa, in West Texas. A memorandum
said a geologist expected the lease to produce oil for at least fifty years.</p>
<p>Roy H. Hofheinz, the mayor of Houston in 1953, disclosed at a press conference
that he had recently made his first million dollars, though he was unsure of
the exact date. &ldquo;You just don&rsquo;t notice things like that,&rdquo; he said. The oilman Robert
E. Smith has described newspaper estimates of many fortunes as &ldquo;paper profits.&rdquo;
But some fortunes were as surprising as they were real. In 1957, when a Houston
oilman&rsquo;s former secretary died at the age of eighty, her estate was found to be
worth $790,031.</p>
<p>A query by a New York matron, visiting Houston for the first time, showed
America&rsquo;s credulity in Houston&rsquo;s millionaire legend. Passing the Rice University
campus&mdash;three hundred acres of lawn; buildings in Byzantine, Moorish, Italian,
and Spanish architectures&mdash;she said, &ldquo;Tell me, who lives there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of the lingering legend, Houston is in fact a city of working people.
They came en masse during World War II, more than forty thousand to the shipyards
alone, and most remained. Unlike the state, whose population has grown
mainly from the excess of births over deaths, Houston has grown also from people
moving in from the rest of Texas and other states.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s population differs widely from that of most other American urban
areas, having proportionately fewer industrial workers and more professional,
technical, and white-collar workers. The difference is caused by automation and
by the technical nature of the four dominant industries. Processing oil, natural
gas, and especially petrochemicals requires fewer but more highly trained workers
than many industries, as does the work to be done by concerns allied with the
space center. Such workers get comparatively higher pay, which has made Houston
a city with more houses and fewer apartments than older American cities of
comparable size.</p>
<p>No city is all of a piece, and Houston&rsquo;s oneness is relieved by the variant
peoples merging with it since the beginning.</p>
<p>A Greek kaffeneion, a large room, nearly bare, with a ceiling of ornately
stamped tin, is a walk-up reached through the unmarked door of an old downtown
building. There the city&rsquo;s Greeks, and only Greeks, drink the coffee of their
homeland&mdash;a strong brew, neither sweet nor bitter, of a strange, nearly syrupy
consistency.</p>
<p>The oriental mysteries of the shrine room of the On Leong tong&mdash;the word
tong is shunned now, and they call it a Chinese Merchants Association&mdash;is on the
second floor of the tong&rsquo;s modern building on the northeastern fringe of the skyscrapers.
The first Chinese, three hundred of them, came in 1870. Two thousand
now live in Houston&mdash;two thousand of the city&rsquo;s most exemplary citizens.</p>
<p>The Houston Turn-Verein, founded in 1854, is one of the oldest organizations
in the city. The Germans, immigrating to Texas in great numbers in the nineteenth
century, came early to Houston and were a dominant element in the city from the
1850s until well after Reconstruction. Edward King, a Yankee journalist who visited
the city in 1873, wrote that &ldquo;the Germans, who are very numerous and well to do
in the city, have their Volks-fests and beer-absorbings, when the city takes on an
absolutely Teutonic air.&rdquo; Gradually the Germans have merged with all Houston,
one loss of which was the virtual extinction of their magnificent singing societies.</p>
<p>Frosttown, Chaneyville, Freedmantown, Chapmanville, and Jourdeville, local
names for parts of an older city, have vanished, but a newcomer called Frenchtown
still lives. Its street names are lyrics&mdash;Deschaumes, Delia, Roland, Adelia,
Lelia&mdash;and the tiny Creole oasis is seasoned with music and dance rituals unknown
in the rest of Houston. Frenchtown&rsquo;s people, coming from Louisiana during hard
times in the early 1920s, settled in a few blocks off Liberty Road, and there they
have remained as one family, little altered in forty years by the changing city
surrounding them.</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s Mexican group lacks the color and ritual of San Antonio&rsquo;s, but it
is the second largest national group in the city. Western Slavs, mainly Czechs and
Poles, have lived in Houston for many decades, especially the Czechs. A few Japanese,
most of whom excel as truck farmers and rice growers, live outside the city.
Many foreign traders, scientists, and executives have been drawn to Houston by
cotton and oil and chemicals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>The state&rsquo;s largest concentration of Negroes lives in Houston, which ranks
ninth in the nation in the proportion of Negroes to the total population. Nearly a
quarter of a million Negroes live in the metropolitan area, or roughly one in five
persons. In an article about Negro millionaires in Texas, <i>Ebony</i> Magazine said in
1952, &ldquo;Houston is sometimes called the &lsquo;Bagdad of Negro America.&rsquo;&rdquo; It is said also
that Houston Negroes have a higher per capita wealth than those of any other
American city.</p>
<p>What a change in one century! Frederick Law Olmsted, one of the most
important historical figures to have written about Houston, came to the city in
1854. Writing in <i>The Cotton Kingdom</i>, he said of Houston: &ldquo;There is a prominent
slavemart in town, which holds a large lot of likely looking negroes, waiting purchasers.
In the windows of shops, and on the doors and columns of the hotel, are
many written advertisements, headed &lsquo;A likely negro girl for sale.&rsquo; 'Two negroes
for sale.&rsquo; &lsquo;Twenty negro boys for sale,&rsquo; etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his book <i>The Great South</i>, Edward King said Negroes &ldquo;have had something
to do with the city government [of Houston] during the reconstruction era,
and the supervisor of streets, and some members of the city council, at the time
of my sojourn there [in 1873], were negroes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston has proportionately few native Houstonians. The board of directors
of the Chamber of Commerce, where natives might be thought to dominate,
reflects the newness of the population. Of the board&rsquo;s twenty-nine members in
1956, eleven moved to the city after 1945, seven in 1951 or later. Only one of the
twenty-nine was born in Houston, only eleven more were born elsewhere in Texas.</p>
<p>Yet a fleck of truth still lingers in what Alexander E. Sweet and J. Armoy
Knox wrote of Houston in 1883: &ldquo;After you have listened to the talk of one of these
pioneer veterans for some time, you begin to feel that the creation of the world,
the arrangement of the solar system, and all subsequent events, including the discovery
of America, were provisions of an all-wise Providence, arranged with a
direct view to the advancement of the commercial interests of Houston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fifty miles inland, Houston is one of the
nation&rsquo;s principal world ports. Being rich in oil and natural gas, it has come to
dominate two mammoth industries, petrochemicals and the sending of natural gas
to the nation. For half a century beginning in the early 1900s, Houston belonged
to oil. For the next half-century, it may belong to space.</p>
<p>Oil and its big quick profits&mdash;little is said of its big quick losses&mdash;and the
extravagant legends about oil riches did more than anything except the Houston
Ship Channel to give Houston its One Million. The city got a foretaste of its oil
destiny thirty-five years before the Spindletop gusher roared in when Richard W.
Dowling, the Confederate hero of the Battle of Sabine Pass, and John M. Fennerty
formed a company in 1866 for &ldquo;Mechanical operations in mining and boring
for oil....&rdquo; Their project was ridiculed, and its outcome is unknown.</p>
<p>The historian Andrew Forest Muir has shown that two critical periods in the
growth of Houston were the half-decade from 1857 to 1861, when it became the
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
rail center of Texas, and the decade beginning with the Spindletop gusher in 1901.
Two others are the decade after the Houston Ship Channel was opened late in
1914&mdash;a period further stimulated by World War I&mdash;and the fifteen years beginning
just before World War II. The inception of the federal space laboratory
begins a fifth cycle of growth.</p>

</div>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s quick growth between 1940 and 1960, when its population rose
from twenty-first to seventh place among American cities, owed to the linking of
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
three benefits: the ship channel, which gave the city access to the world; immense
resources of oil, natural gas, sulphur, lime, salt, and water; and the fact that the
product of one chemical plant is often the raw material of another. This combination
created on the banks of the ship channel one of the world&rsquo;s greatest concentrations
of petrochemical industries&mdash;chemical plants dependent on the by-products
of refining oil. The tempo increased in the early 1960s, when the Monsanto
Chemical Company began building the world&rsquo;s largest ethylene plant at a cost of
fifty million dollars. Du Pont began building a hydrofluoric acid plant, and an
important polypropylene plastic and film plant was being built.</p>

<p>During the 1950s Houston was a leading example of the new urban America
caused by the economic impetus of World War II and the increased post-war
migration of rural people to cities. No period in the city&rsquo;s history approaches the
importance of World War II and the years after. Before the war Houston was
an ambitious small city. A few years afterward, its former hopes lying in the
shadows of sudden and preposterous growth, the city was altered in character,
aspirations, and appearance.</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s formidable roles in the oil and gas industries, in the manufacturing
of oil-field equipment, and in the nationwide distribution of gas are widely understood
but seldom comprehended. The metropolitan area alone, which has seven
oil refineries, produces nearly eighty thousand barrels of oil daily. Two major oil
companies, the Humble Oil and Refining Company and the Continental Oil Company,
and hundreds of smaller ones have their headquarters in Houston, most of
whose downtown skyscrapers were built by or for oil, gas, and banking.</p>
<p>The Tennessee Gas Transmission Company was organized in 1944; twelve
years later its assets passed a billion dollars, a speed of growth that may never
have been equaled in American business. Paul Kayser, president of the El Paso
Natural Gas Company, was asked at a press conference in El Paso why his company,
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
which owns El Paso&rsquo;s tallest building and supplies West Texas gas to western
states, has its headquarters in Houston. He answered that the only place in
America to keep in touch with the oil business is Houston.</p>

<p>In 1960 most of the nation&rsquo;s sulphur deposits, around 6 per cent of its petroleum
reserves, and around 10 per cent of its refining capacity were in a nineteen-county
area surrounding Houston. An estimated three-quarters of the nation&rsquo;s
petrochemicals production comes from the Texas Gulf Coast area. Shipbuilding,
an integrated steel mill, and paper mills are other important aspects of the city&rsquo;s
economy.</p>
<p>It is a paradox that the Houston metropolitan area, which is hundreds of
miles from the state&rsquo;s chief cattle-raising areas, has more cattle than any other
county in Texas. Irrigation has made the county a rice producer of importance;
within a hundred-mile radius of Houston is grown 28 per cent of the nation&rsquo;s rice.
And Houston, which is the headquarters for Anderson, Clayton &amp; Company, the
largest cotton concern in the world, is one of the world&rsquo;s leading spot cotton
markets.</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s gusto in the 1950s was epitomized by &ldquo;M&rdquo; Day, as July 3, 1954,
was called. When statisticians divined ahead of time that the city&rsquo;s metropolitan
population would reach one million on that date, a festival was planned to welcome
the millionth citizen. Houston Bucks were printed in a denomination of
$1,000,000. A huge thermometer, its peak registering 1,000,000, was put at the
Rice Hotel corner and the reading raised a notch a day. Thousands of auto-bumper
signs said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m One in a Million&mdash;Houston.&rdquo; Many concerns changed their postage-meter
messages to read &ldquo;Houston&rsquo;s a Million Strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a town meeting held in Hermann Park on July 3, Mr. Million was identified
as B. C. McCasland, Jr., who moved to the city the day before from Clinton,
Mississippi. Aged thirty-six, a geologist, and the father of five children, he typified
the city at that moment. Receiving gifts said to be worth $10,000, he was
flown to the eleven cities then larger than Houston&mdash;to talk about Houston. He
moved away some time afterward, but &ldquo;M&rdquo; Day may not have been premature.
A year and a half later, when the Bureau of the Census estimated the populations
of Houston, Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Washington, the population of Houston
was put at 1,077,000.</p>

<p>The history of Houston&rsquo;s material success is to some extent the history of its
port and the bayou it was to make into a ship channel. Buffalo Bayou was once
the mouth of the Brazos River, though the Brazos long ago cut its present course
to the southwest. A traveler who wrote of the bayou nearly ten years before
Houston existed found it an exceptional stream. &ldquo;... this most enchanting little
stream [has] the appearance of an artificial canal in the design and course of
which Nature has lent her masterly hand,&rdquo; J. C. Clopper wrote in 1828. Other
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
early travelers were to comment on Buffalo Bayou&rsquo;s &ldquo;strong resemblance to a
canal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, Andrew Forest Muir has written, &ldquo;Buffalo Bayou had another
peculiar advantage.... Unlike most significant Texas streams, it flows almost due
east and west. With the Brazos [River] extending in a general northerly direction,
this meant that the head of navigation on the Bayou was but twenty miles or so
from the heart of the fertile agricultural region of the Brazos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, Buffalo Bayou was the principal reason the founders of Houston
chose the area for their city. They wanted the most interior point of year-round
navigation in Texas. Unable to buy the town of Harrisburg, they went upstream
for their site.</p>
<p>A vessel of size first succeeded in reaching a boat-landing at Houston in
1837. It was a former warship, the Constitution, a forty-four-gun frigate in 1797
but then a merchant vessel, whose captain chanced the voyage to win $1000
offered by the new city&rsquo;s promoters. Within ten years vessels were making daily
runs between Houston and Galveston.</p>
<p>The improvement of the bayou channel was begun in 1839 with funds raised
by public subscription and lotteries. The Port of Houston was established by city
ordinance in 1841. Widening and deepening of the channel was begun in 1869
and continued into the 1960s, by which time the minimum depth of the channel
was thirty-six feet and the minimum width was three hundred feet. The port is
linked with the Intracoastal Canal. &ldquo;Probably the greatest, most farseeing project
ever consummated in Texas was the deepwater channel to Houston,&rdquo; the Dallas
News said in an editorial in 1955.</p>
<p>One price of the project&rsquo;s material benefits was the loss of one of the area&rsquo;s
chief natural beauties, a beauty remarked by many travelers in the nineteenth
century. &ldquo;... this most enchanting little stream,&rdquo; Clopper wrote in 1828. Edward
King foresaw in 1873 what was to happen to the lovely bayou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bayou which leads from Houston to Galveston ... is overhung by lofty
and graceful magnolias; and in the season of their blossoming, one may sail for
miles along the channel with the heavy, passionate fragrance of the queen flower
drifting about him,&rdquo; he wrote nearly a century ago. And then: &ldquo;This bayou Houston
hopes one day to widen and dredge all the way to Galveston; but its prettiness
and romance will then be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it goes.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The Kellum-Noble House</i></p>
</div>
<p>With a median age of 27.5 years, Houston&rsquo;s
population is the youngest of America&rsquo;s big cities. The city itself seems younger
than it is, for since the 1920s Houston has given the impression of being always
new. Few structures stand long enough to become old. When the lovely patina of
age does get a chance to form, it is scrubbed away as though it were an embarrassment,
or so it was removed in 1962 from the bronze of Sam Houston&rsquo;s equestrian
statue in Hermann Park. Houstonians have shown little compassion for their
city&rsquo;s past.</p>
<p>No structure has been preserved from Houston&rsquo;s early days except a two-story
brick trading post, built in 1848, on Congress Avenue; the Kellum-Noble house,
the main part of which was built in 1847; and the Rice-Cherry house, which may
date from 1850. The two houses now stand behind the City Hall in the small Sam
Houston Park. &ldquo;What one misses most in Houston are old things,&rdquo; a Swiss journalist
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
wrote after visiting Houston in 1951. &ldquo;After a few days one sings the praise
of the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some old things, obscure trifles, evoke a period when Houston was a Main
Street town. A city slogan of the early 1900s&mdash;&ldquo;Where the Mock Bird has no sorrow
in his song, no winter in his year&rdquo;&mdash;suggests municipal aspirations inconceivable
in the Houston of half a century later. Now it is &ldquo;Space Center, USA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And some old things evoke a period when tenacious civic pride fed on delusions
that were privately understood but never confessed. Judge an extravagant
sentenceful of wishful thinking in the Houston edition of <i>The Standard Blue Book
of Texas</i> for 1907: &ldquo;Nowhere are the flowers fairer, the skies bluer or the trees
greener than in the beautiful residence environs of this city, and nowhere in this
great and powerful Southland is a more gracious and unbounded hospitality dispensed
by more attractive and winsome chatelaines than adorn the handsome
homes of Houston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Houston&rsquo;s past may be suggested by other than old things. The Southwest
and the frontier are recalled by the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo
and its annual prelude, the Salt Grass Trail, on which hundreds of city people
ride horseback for three days to retrace a pioneer cattle trail. Silky stalactites of
Spanish moss, dripping from oaks and sweet gums, faintly evoke Houston&rsquo;s role
in the old South. But the primitiveness and individualism of the wild west and
the relaxation of the Southern mood have been shed. Though Houston was shaped
to a large extent by the South and the Southwest, it has come to be lightly marked
by those regions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is partly an unconscious romanticism and it is partly a conscious cult that
one still thinks of Houston as pre-eminently a Texas city,&rdquo; Hubert Mewhinney
wrote in the Houston <i>Post</i>. &ldquo;But it is not. Houston since the (Second World) war
... has not been so much Texan as generalized American....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p18a.jpg" alt="Music Hall" width="800" height="284" />
</div>
<p>In becoming so, it gained in a way that has been concealed by the city&rsquo;s more
arresting millionaire legend. Slowly, perceptibly, Houston is becoming cosmopolitan.
With its interest in music, art, and the theater, with its universities and
medical schools, Houston is becoming an important center of culture. But nearly
all is new: the organization dates of only the symphony, one art museum, and
the universities precede World War II, those of only the symphony and one university
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
precede World War I. No cultural institution dates from the nineteenth
century, though a tradition of opera and theater goes far back.</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s musical life has long been centered in its symphony, which gives
the city much more than symphony music. From its first and second chairs come
most of the musicians in the chamber music groups, which are the most remarkable
new development in the city&rsquo;s cultural life. Sir John Barbirolli succeeded
Leopold Stokowski in 1961 as conductor of the symphony, which was organized
in 1913.</p>
<p>The Music Guild, organized in 1948, is the oldest of three chamber music
groups of distinction, and the J. S. Bach Society, one of the few performing Bach
groups in America, gave its first concerts in 1954. The Houston Grand Opera Association
was organized in 1955. During the six years Stokowski led the symphony
he organized the Contemporary Music Society, which gave its first concert in 1959.</p>
<p>The Alley, one of three Houston theaters operating the year around, is one of
the premier theaters of America. Directors, actors, and writers from many countries
have come to Houston to study the arena theater&rsquo;s work. Directed by Nina
Vance since it opened in 1947, the Alley has received substantial grants from the
Ford Foundation. The Playhouse, whose arena theater was the first in America
to be built for professional use, has operated under various managements since
it was opened in 1951. Theatre, Inc., occupying the proscenium hall of the old
Houston Little Theatre, has mostly produced musicals since it was organized
in 1953.</p>
<p>The Houston Museum of Fine Arts, directed by James Johnson Sweeney since
1961, developed into an important art center under the long direction of James
Chillman. Growing from an art league organized in 1900, the museum opened in
1924; it was the first art museum in Texas. Two wings were added in 1926, the
Blaffer Memorial Wing in 1953, and the beautiful Cullinan Hall&mdash;the Big Room&mdash;in
1958. The last, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, gave the museum a new
entrance and made it one of the city&rsquo;s architectural distinctions. The museum is
strongest in paintings of the European Renaissance. Important collections have
been given by Edith A. and Percy S. Straus and Samuel H. Kress, of New York,
and the Robert Lee Blaffer family and Miss Ima Hogg, of Houston.</p>
<p>The Contemporary Arts Association, organized in 1948, conducts an exhibitions
museum. One of the few American museums devoted solely to the art of the
twentieth century, its beneficial effects on the city&rsquo;s art life have been far out of
proportion to its budgets or the size of its exhibition hall, both small.</p>
<p>A notable omission in Houston&rsquo;s cultural life has always been a satisfactory
natural history museum, but one is to be built at last. The Houston Museum of
Natural Science and Planetarium is to be built in Hermann Park at a cost of
$2,500,000, possibly by 1964.</p>
<p>The principal universities are Rice University, chartered in 1891 but opened
for instruction in 1912; the University of Houston, established in 1934; the Baylor
University College of Medicine, which opened in Dallas in 1900 but was removed
to the Texas Medical Center in Houston in 1943; Texas Southern University, established
in 1934 as the Houston College for Negroes; and the newer St. Thomas
University, a Roman Catholic school.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>The superlative of the city&rsquo;s exuberance is the Texas Medical Center. But for
one hospital the area, lying just south of Hermann Park, was a forest within the
city in 1946. A decade later, at a cost of more than $50,000,000, most of it paid by
Houston oil and cotton philanthropies, one of the nation&rsquo;s leading medical research,
educational, and hospital centers was well on the way to completion.</p>

<p class="tb">Though hospitals and universities and the arts help measure a city&rsquo;s culture,
so do department stores, restaurants, and sports. The last is big business in
Houston.</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s years of stars are one reason: Eddie Dyer and Dizzy Dean in baseball,
George Blanda and Billy Cannon in professional football, Pete Cawthon,
college football player and coach, Jimmy Demaret and Jack Burke in golf, the
great hurdler Fred Wolcott, Wilbur Hess in intercollegiate tennis, A. C. Glassell,
Jr. in fishing, Grant Ilseng in skeet shooting. But the big reason is the mild climate;
Houston sports are a year-round activity.</p>
<p>Golf to yachting, hunting to deep sea fishing, Houstonians can span the calendar
as participants. And as spectators they have Southwest Conference and University
of Houston sports and the noted track teams of Texas Southern University;
they have major league baseball and football&mdash;the Houston Colt .45s in the
National Baseball League and the Houston Oilers in the American Football
League; in tennis they have the nationally famous River Oaks Country Club Tournament
and in golf the Houston Classic Invitational Tournament; and they have
the annual Pin Oak Charity Horse Show, one of America&rsquo;s leading horse shows.</p>

<p>Houston&rsquo;s character and personality
are by no means revealed merely by ticking off oil, a bewildering chemicals complex,
a seaport, and an exaggerated reputation for materialism. Consider some
enigma variations on an urban theme:</p>
<p>Metropolitan, urban, big-city Houston&mdash;where E. H. Marks has one of the
largest herds of Longhorn cattle in the world, where cattle rustling still flourishes,
where wolves still thrive and a few mountain lions still roam in the bottoms.</p>
<p>The evangelist Billy Graham, exhorting a crowd of forty thousand in Rice
Stadium in 1952, called Houston &ldquo;a more wicked city than Hollywood.&rdquo; He said
earlier &ldquo;that less people probably go to church in Houston than in any other city
in Texas.&rdquo; Yet the city has more than twelve hundred churches.</p>
<p>Houston is said to be well planned. Yet it is the largest city in America without
zoning and more than three hundred of its streets have duplicate names. Main
Street, or so the legend goes, is the longest in the world, sometimes merely the
longest in the country. No doubt it is neither; still, from end to end within the city
limits, the Main Stem measures 19.1 miles.</p>
<p>In Houston a prudent pedestrian looks both ways before crossing a one-way
street. Houstonians, a safe-driving expert said, are the most zealous horn-blowers
in the land. In 1961 another expert told the City Council that Houstonians lead
all Americans in shunning public transportation to drive their own cars.</p>

<p>In Houston, the U.S. Department of Labor disclosed in 1961, a retired couple
could live more cheaply than in any other of twenty big cities. Other years, other
distinctions: Houston won two municipal championships in the early 1950s, when
it led American cities in murders in 1951 and was chosen the cleanest city in the
United States in 1953. It was to learn later that it had held another distinction for
decades, being second to none in using the word &ldquo;chocolate&rdquo; to name things. &ldquo;The
Houston list is far beyond anything possessed by any other place in the world,&rdquo; a
college professor wrote to Mayor Lewis Cutrer. Small wonder: Chocolate Bay,
Chocolate Bayou, Old Chocolate Road, and Chocolate Springs, to list four of ten
such names he found. And in Houston, surely <i>only</i> in Houston, the city garbage
dump came to smell like a rose&mdash;to the city treasurer. Eleven oil wells drilled at
the dump in the 1950s paid the city more than $250,000 in royalties before they
were shut down.</p>

<p class="tb">Nothing about Houston is more enigmatic than its weather. The weather long
ago made Houston the site of one of its principal experiment stations.</p>
<p>W. D. Bedell has written that Houston, more than any other big Texas city, is
a crossroads of weather. &ldquo;Here we can have Dallas weather or Caribbean weather
or Colorado weather or Arizona weather,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Houston gets more Caribbean
and Gulf of Mexico weather than any other major Texas city. That is the
steam bath kind of weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston gets more steam bath weather than any other kind. In 1952, when
the Prudential Insurance Company transferred scores of employees from New
Jersey to its new Southwestern Home Office in Houston, it prepared an immigrant&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
guide. The question &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the Climate?&rdquo; was answered: &ldquo;To be perfectly
frank about Houston&rsquo;s weather, even a Texan wouldn&rsquo;t brag about it in the summertime.
It&rsquo;s hot and it&rsquo;s sticky.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">
<img src="images/p24.jpg" alt="" width="796" height="582" />
<p class="pcap"><i>On February 14, 1895, Houston received what may have been the heaviest
snow in its history&mdash;twenty-two inches. The old Burns house, shown on the
day of the snowfall, occupied the site of the twenty-one story Texas National
Bank Building.</i></p>
</div>
<p>After the St. Louis Cardinals played their first games in Houston in 1962,
Stan Musial said the city has only three seasons&mdash;&ldquo;Summer, and then July and
August.&rdquo; Members of the British diplomatic service are paid an extra allowance
when they serve in such equatorial places as Aruba, Burma, Indonesia, Panama,
the Persian Gulf&mdash;and Houston.</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s Christmases, on the other hand, are mostly mild and green, a climate&rsquo;s
benedictions, decorated by nature with holly, yaupon, and roses. Houston
nearly got a White Christmas in 1929, when 2.3 inches of snow fell on December
21 and 22, but in fact the last White Christmas appears to have been in 1859. A
legend says Houston gets really cold only once every ten years, and many big
storms do come in that pattern. Of modern cold spells, the big ice show of 1951
was the most severe. From January 29 to February 3, Houston had 123 hours&mdash;more
than five days and nights&mdash;of below-freezing temperatures. Most of the
city&rsquo;s few freezes last less than a day.</p>
<p>Sometimes it rains and rains. And sometimes you despair that it may never
rain again. Rarely does it rain a gentle rain; rarely does it rain just right. The rain
in Houston falls mainly all at once. July, August, and September are the months
of the hurricane season, but modern warning systems have much diminished the
peril of the storms. The most destructive modern storm affecting Houston was
Hurricane Carla, which struck the Texas Gulf Coast early in September, 1961.</p>

<p>In late fall, winter, and early spring cold winds blow down across the top of
Texas, pushing fast across most of the state, sometimes reaching down into the
lower Rio Grande Valley in southernmost Texas. Texans call these cold waves
&ldquo;northers&rdquo;&mdash;blue northers or wet northers or dry northers. What distinguishes a
norther from a plain cold wave is the sudden, dramatic drop in temperature,
sometimes 20 to 30 degrees in two hours.</p>
<p>Most northers are preceded by heralds: the still, sultry air; the scent of sulphur
or burning hay or charcoal; the haze, slowly, ominously obscuring the sun.
Birds and beasts almost always know beforehand; often man can tell. Then, suddenly,
the temperature falls and sounds break the stillness, first a low soughing
of the wind, then bedlam as the fury commands the city.</p>
<p>Arriving in Houston in 1873, Edward King instantly experienced his first
norther, &ldquo;which came raving and tearing over the town.... It was glorious, exhilarating,
and&mdash;icy.&rdquo; The infrequent northers are confined, like the oyster, to months
with an &ldquo;r,&rdquo; but mostly to November, December, and January.</p>
<p>Nothing about Houston is harder to pin down than its weather. A magazine
published for employees of the Humble Oil and Refining Company&rsquo;s Baytown
refinery printed a full-page warning in January, 1957: &ldquo;Although the weather may
be warm when you go to work, it&rsquo;s a good idea to take a top coat along to guard
against a sudden drop in temperature.&rdquo; The simultaneous variety of the state&rsquo;s
weather was shown by a headline on Page 1 of the Houston Post of September
11, 1955:</p>

the founders of Houston, were neither heroes of the Texas revolution&mdash;they did
not fight in the Battle of San Jacinto or in any other&mdash;nor were they distinguished
in other ways. They were land speculators, New Yorkers who came to Texas in the
summer of 1832. Augustus had just turned thirty, John was twenty-six when they
bought the land for Houston.</p>
<p>Though the Allens&rsquo; town would become one of the leading cities of North
America, though it would one day be abashed by a legend of riches, neither profited
much for his pains. John Allen died in Houston two years after buying the
land. Augustus lived until 1864, but he left Houston in 1850 after signing over to
his wife Charlotte most of his remaining interests. Of this trio, only Charlotte was
to profit from the Texas city conceived by New Yorkers. Living to a great age,
she still owned Houston land when she died at her home, now the site of the Gulf
Building, on August 3, 1895.</p>
<p>Augustus Allen lived always on the verge of success. In poor health most of
his life, he was early a bookworm, a taste which may have led to his first job, when
he was seventeen, as a mathematics teacher in upstate New York. In 1827, when
he was twenty-one, he moved to New York City, where he was first a bookkeeper
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
and then a partner in H. and H. Canfield Company. Five years later he and John,
who had joined him in New York in 1829, moved to Texas, eventually settling in
Nacogdoches. With other speculators, the pair dealt in Mexican land titles. They
began their Houston venture soon after Texas won its independence.</p>

</div>
<p>Little seems to be known of Augustus&rsquo; life during the fifteen years he lived in
Houston. No doubt that owes less to mystery than to the prosaic nature of selling
real estate. But some mystery does surround his separation from Charlotte in 1850.</p>
<p>The land for Houston had been bought with money Mrs. Allen had inherited
from her father, and in time she became dissatisfied with her husband&rsquo;s management
of the property. They separated but did not get a divorce, &ldquo;both husband
and wife pledging to keep the details of their troubles secret,&rdquo; Amelia W. Williams
has written. They seem to have succeeded.</p>
<p>Ill, and surely once more disappointed in his luck, Augustus moved again,
this time to Mexico, where he and the Mexican leader Benito Juarez became
friends. In 1852 he was appointed United States consul for the Pacific port of
Tehuantepec, and in 1858 he was also given the same post at the port of Minatitlan
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
on the Gulf side of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. During these years he and a
Briton developed what is thought to have been a successful shipping concern.</p>
<p>In 1864, apparently realizing that he was critically ill, he went to Washington
to resign his consulships. There he died of pneumonia on June 11, less than a
month before his fifty-ninth birthday. He died without ever returning to the city
he and his brother conceived. Augustus was buried in Brooklyn; only one of the
city&rsquo;s founders, John Allen, is buried in Houston.</p>
<p class="tb">The area now covered by Houston was first settled by Anglo-Americans
before 1826, when a townsite was surveyed for John Richardson Harris, who
named the place Harrisburg. An upstate New Yorker who was a member of
Stephen F. Austin&rsquo;s first Texas colony, Harris was granted a league of land&mdash;4,428
acres&mdash;at the junction of Buffalo and Brays Bayous. One of the first steam sawmills
in Texas was built at Harrisburg in 1829, and by 1836 the hamlet also had
perhaps twenty houses, most of which were log cabins.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">the Original Plan of Houston</span></p>
</div>
<p>Harrisburg might have succeeded, and what was to become one of the
principal American cities might have been called Harrisburg rather than Houston,
but for at least two events besides the death of Harris in 1829. On April 16, 1836,
Santa Anna, in hot pursuit of Sam Houston and the Texas army, rode into the
almost deserted hamlet and burned it. The second event, the decision of those
other upstate New Yorkers, the Allens, to start a town at the most interior point of
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
year-round navigation in Texas, joined with the first to overcome Harrisburg&rsquo;s
ambitions.</p>
<p>The Allens and others had eyed the Harrisburg area with shrewd expectations.
It was early seen that Buffalo Bayou would become important as an exit
route for cotton and other crops grown in the rich agricultural lands along the
Brazos River. The Allens first tried to buy the Harrisburg property. But its title
was involved in fraudulent claims made against Harris&rsquo;s estate and they chose a
site a few miles farther up the bayou. On August 24 and 26, 1836, they bought the
bulk of the John Austin survey, paying $5,000 for half a league and $1 an acre
for a league.</p>
<p>Thus the original townsite&mdash;6,642 acres south of Buffalo Bayou&mdash;cost the
Allens $9,428. A Main Street corner a few blocks south of the original city was
sold in 1940 for $1,150,000; seven years later, or 110 years after the Allens sold
the first lots in Houston, Woolworth bought the corner for $3,050,000&mdash;or at the
rate of $2000 a front inch.</p>
<p>On September 30, 1836, the Allens advertised their nonexistent town in the
<i>Telegraph and Texas Register</i>, saying Houston would become &ldquo;beyond all doubt,
the great interior commercial emporium of Texas.&rdquo; In October, when Houston
was still but a prairie, John Allen made a proposal to the congress of the Republic
of Texas, then meeting at Columbia. Move the government to Houston, he said,
and the Allens would build a capitol for it. &ldquo;Capitalists are interested in this
town,&rdquo; the brothers&rsquo; petition to congress said of the vacant land, and congress
voted to move the government to Houston temporarily. The Allens, having made
their town the capital of the republic before the town existed, began building in
fact what had succeeded in fancy.</p>
<p>They had already hired Gail and Thomas Borden, publishers of the <i>Telegraph
and Texas Register</i> and also surveyors, to stake out the town. Gail, a notable
figure in early Texas history, would later make his fortune by inventing a process
for condensing milk. But the Bordens were busy in Columbia, where their newspaper
was then published, and most of the surveying was done by Moses Lapham,
a young Ohioan who worked for the Bordens. He began staking out the town
early in October, 1836. When he finished seven weeks later, the Bordens announced
in their newspaper, &ldquo;We have at length, and almost without the use of
mechanical instruments, completed a plan for the City of HOUSTON....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The historian Joe B. Frantz could find no record of what the Allens paid
Lapham or the Bordens for surveying Houston. &ldquo;From the extant record,&rdquo; Frantz
wrote, &ldquo;it would appear that Lapham received only a bad case of chills, for which
he drank &lsquo;heavy draugts (<i>sic</i>) of black pepper and sassafras tea.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two years later, while surveying near San Antonio for Samuel Maverick,
Lapham was scalped by Indians. Like one of the city&rsquo;s founders, the man who
laid out Houston is buried elsewhere, in San Antonio.</p>
<p>The original city was laid out from Buffalo Bayou on the north to, but not
including, Texas Avenue on the south, and on the west from the bend in the bayou
behind the Music Hall to, but not including, Crawford Street on the east. The
east-west streets were laid out roughly parallel with the bayou and thus do not
lie on a true east-west line but are many degrees off the compass.</p>
<p>Writing in 1958, Andrew Forest Muir showed that January 19, 1837, marks
the beginning of Houston. &ldquo;With the exception of one lot that had been sold on
January 1, 1837, the first purchases were made on January 19, which is probably
the most reasonable date to mark the beginning of the city of Houston as such,&rdquo;
he wrote. &ldquo;Early in January, 1837, the town was so devoid of an existence that
Francis Richard Lubbock with a party in a yawl passed the townsite without
realizing it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<div class="img" id="fig44">
<img src="images/p27.jpg" alt="" width="691" height="1000" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Neighbors: the First Methodist Church, completed in 1910, and the Texas
National Bank Building, completed in 1955.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Even in the beginning the property was astonishingly valuable, so much so
that some land was sold in 12&frac12; foot lots. Indeed, lots are said to have been sold
for as much as $10,000, but Muir found nothing during the town&rsquo;s first six months
to substantiate that. Examining all the conveyances of record through June 20,
1837, he found only one lot that sold for $5,000 and another for $3,000. Most of
them sold for no more than $500. But $500 was a considerable price for a small
piece of virtually unimproved village land in 1837, even in a new republic&rsquo;s
temporary capital.</p>
<p>The government moved to Houston in May, 1837, before the building to
house it was finished, and the city was incorporated in June. Houston remained
the capital of the republic until January, 1840, and it was again the capital, briefly,
in 1842. Muddy and beset by recurring yellow fever epidemics, it grew slowly
after the capital was removed to Austin.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig45">
<img src="images/p28.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="445" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Looking south on Main Street in 1910, when the street still ended at Buffalo
Bayou, from the point where the Main Street bridge now spans the bayou.</i></p>
</div>
<p>One of the best early descriptions of Houston is that of Mary Austin Holley,
who saw the town in December, 1837: &ldquo;The Main street of this city of a year
extends from the landing <a id="the">foot of Main Street</a> into the prairie.... On this
main street are two large hotels, 2 stories, with galleries (crowded to overflowing)
several stores 2 stories&mdash;painted white&mdash;one block of eleven stores (rent $500
each)&mdash;some 2 story dwelling houses&mdash;&amp; then the capitol ... painted peach blossom
about &frac14; mile from the landing. Other streets, parallel, &amp; at right angles, are
built on here and there, but chiefly designated by stakes. One story dwellings are
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
scattered in the edge of the timber which forms an amphitheatre round the prairie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The early Houston seems to have been distinguished for its wickedness. In
January, 1838, the diarist John Hunter Herndon called it &ldquo;the greatest sink of
disipation (<i>sic</i>) and vice that modern times have known.&rdquo; After living in Houston
two and a half months longer, he wrote. &ldquo;What a den of villains must there not
be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis C. Sheridan, a young Irishman in the British diplomatic service, saw
Houston in 1840, when he wrote: &ldquo;The most uncivilised place in Texas is I believe
Houston the former Capital&mdash;I heard and read of more outrage and blackguardism
in that town ... than throughout the whole of Texas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However all that may have been, the early Houston shared one characteristic
with the city of a century and a quarter later. Gustav Dresel, a young German who
came to Texas in 1838, wrote in the autumn of 1839: &ldquo;Nine months only had gone
by since I had left Houston, but how different did it all look! I discovered more
than twice the number of houses. Whole squares had been added, and I noticed
new streets.&rdquo; The population then numbered between two and three thousand.</p>
<p>Early Houstonians had the good fortune to be spared the Indian raids and
massacres that harassed some of frontier Texas. But Indians were no novelty in
Houston. On March 18, 1838, Herndon wrote, &ldquo;Many Indians in town who made
much noise. A squaw drunk, the first I ever saw.&rdquo; Muir has written, &ldquo;To the best
of the writer&rsquo;s knowledge, there were never any Indian raids, battles or massacres
in the Houston area during the time Anglo-Americans have lived here. Certainly
there were Indians, however, for as late as 1846 a priest from St. Vincent&rsquo;s [Roman
Catholic] Church baptized a crowd of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The city grew slowly until the Civil War, when Houstonians voted overwhelmingly
for the secession of Texas from the United States. During the war
Houston was a lair for blockade runners, and on January 1, 1863, using two small
vessels fortified with bales of cotton, it mounted a sea attack down Buffalo Bayou
and helped recapture Galveston Island from Union forces that had seized the
island three months earlier. In the same year Houston became the headquarters
for the Confederate district of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The period of
Reconstruction lasted from June 20, 1865, when Houston was occupied by Union
troops, until January, 1874. The city&rsquo;s growth between then and World War I
owed first to its importance as a railroad center and then to the Texas oil boom.</p>
<p>Each of four wars, and even a fifth catastrophe, served Houston well. Its
beginnings arose from the Texans&rsquo; victory at the Battle of San Jacinto. Though
its people suffered to some extent from the Civil War and much more from Reconstruction,
Houston got an economic stimulus from the presence of the Confederacy&rsquo;s
Trans-Mississippi headquarters. The city prospered during Reconstruction
because many who abandoned the South moved to Texas. The greatest proportional
growth of the city&rsquo;s population, 111.4 per cent, came in the decade of the
1920s, largely a result of the impetus given by World War I. World War II led to
the most successful period in Houston&rsquo;s history. The city took a decisive lead in
its long competition with Galveston after the Galveston flood and tidal wave of
September 8, 1900, in which an estimated six thousand lives were lost and half
the city was destroyed.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s most effective leaders in the first half of the twentieth century were
Jesse H. Jones, a Secretary of Commerce and head of the Reconstruction Finance
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
Corporation under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Oscar F. Holcombe,
mayor of the city for eleven two-year terms between 1920 and 1957. Its most
gifted, and anonymous, leader was Will C. Hogg, a son of James Stephen Hogg,
the great governor of modern Texas. In 1926, at a personal cost of more than
$50,000, Hogg organized the Forum of Civics with these words from Pericles as
its motto: &ldquo;No Athenian should ever confess that he neglected public services for
the sake of his private fortune.&rdquo; Hogg, an altruist and a man of wealth, died too
soon to fulfill his dreams for the city.</p>
<p>Four benefactors of indelible importance were William Marsh Rice, who endowed
Rice University; George Henry Hermann, an eccentric who was born in
Houston in 1843 and later gave the city a great hospital, Hermann Park, and
Hermann Square downtown; and M. D. Anderson and Hugh Roy Cullen, the
philanthropists.</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s good fortune during its first century and its extraordinary rise
afterward have tempted some to call it a city of destiny. But the clich&eacute; signifies
an irrevocable fate in spite of man&rsquo;s successes or failures. And man, not fate,
decisively controls the fortunes of cities.</p>
<p>How is one city more or less than another? What is Houston compared with
such whole or complete cities as Amsterdam and San Francisco? Only a prophet
could say, for this hopelessly vigorous city is incomplete, unfinished; it cannot
yet be judged as a whole city. Until then, Houstonians possess the rare excitement
of living in a city during the springtime of what may become greatness, a city
budding and shooting with the extravagance of nature&rsquo;s annual renewal, a city
in its feast years.</p>

<h3 id="c8">A HOUSTON VADE MECUM</h3>
<p>Houston, an inland port city of
southeastern Texas, on the Gulf
Coastal Plain, is joined by the Houston
Ship Channel with the Gulf of
Mexico, fifty miles distant, at Galveston.
The ship channel joins the Port of
Houston with the Intracoastal Canal.</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s corporate limits of
349.4 square miles, including the 22
square miles of Lake Houston and a
canal leading to it, surround fourteen
of twenty-eight municipalities in its
metropolitan area, Harris County, of
which Houston is the county seat. The
county&rsquo;s total area is 1,747 square
miles, of which the land area is 1,711
square miles.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s lowest altitude
is 25 feet; the highest is 75
feet. The county&rsquo;s altitude
runs from close to sea level to
310 feet near Tomball, on the
north.</p>
<p>The annual normal rainfall is 45.3
inches.</p>
<p>The annual average temperature
is 70.0&deg; F.</p>
<p>The excess of births over deaths
in the metropolitan area is around
24,000 a year, and each year around
21,000 more persons move to Houston
than move away from it. Thus the
metropolitan area&rsquo;s population increases
by an estimated 45,000 persons
a year&mdash;a conservative figure.</p>
<p>Of the 1,243,158 persons living in
the metropolitan area at the time of
the 1960 census, 634,522 were females
and 608,636 were males, giving females
a lead of 25,886.</p>
<p>In 1960, 94.5 per cent of
the population was urban, 5.5
per cent was rural.</p>
<p>The density of population
was 726.6 persons a square
mile.</p>

<p>Five important Houston building projects,
in various stages of development late in 1962,
totaled a minimum completion cost of $347,500,000.
Construction of a sixth, a new City
Auditorium to be built on the site of the old
one, which was opened in 1910, will begin in
1963 or 1964; money for the new auditorium
was given by Houston Endowment, Inc., a
foundation created by Jesse H. Jones.</p>
<p>The eventual cost of Cullen Center, which
is being built on a six-block site downtown,
will be more than $100,000,000. The first two
buildings, which were nearing completion late
in 1962, are a twenty-five-story office building
and the Hotel America. Cullen Center eventually
will include an office building of fifty
stories or more, two high-rise apartment towers,
and other structures.</p>
<p>The other projects, and their estimated
final costs, are an air conditioned domed stadium
for baseball and football games, $20,000,000;
the Houston Intercontinental Airport,
called Jetero, $125,000,000; the Manned Spacecraft
Center, $100,000,000; and the Houston
Museum of Natural Science and Planetarium,
$2,500,000.</p>

not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
